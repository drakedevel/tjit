Limitations as a whole:

- Link against -lgc if you want garbage collection

Limitations on the parser:

- None known

Limitations on the JIT engine:

- All states receive exactly one page of buffer, which is not bounds-checked
 - I am too lazy to write an executable memory allocator
- Code is suboptimal in places

Limitations on the macro assembler:

- R12 and R13 are not usable as a base register of a location
 - Special cases in encoding which is not handled
- Unlinked jumps will be NOPs if executed prior to linkage
- No bounds checking on assembler buffer
